<h2 id="stellar-populations">Stellar Populations</h2>

<p>Star forming regions,</p>

<p>young stars, 
Young star disk population,</p>

<p>cool halo subdwarfs and thick disk dwarf population</p>

<p>cool halo subdwarfs and thick disk dwarf population
cool subdwarf population and relation to merger history via metallicity constraints</p>

<p>dwarf galaxies
dwarf galaxies, 
ultra faint dwarf galaxies, 
Low mass satellites of the Milky Way and tidal streams
MW faint dwarfs,</p>

<p>Iâ€™m interested in planetary nebulae (mapping galactic structure).</p>

<p>stellar clusters,
globular clusters,
star clusters,<br />
halo star clusters, disk and halo structure and 
stellar populations</p>

<p>halo star clusters, disk and halo structure and 
stellar populations
Stellar populations in general, more from the theoretical/modeling side.</p>

<p>color-magnitude and color-color diagram analysis</p>

<p>Variable stars as distance indicators and population tracers. 
Pulsating stars as stellar population tracers in different enviroment of the Local Group
Using pulsating variable stars to study Galactic structures, 
	RR Lyrae for the halo and streams
	classical Cepheids for the disk. 
	Iâ€™m interested in extragalactic applications as well (ie. Magellanic Clouds and dwarf galaxies)</p>

<p>Deriving the star formation history from star counts in different places of the MW. It requires correcting for the foreground extinction - but it could also help to constrain the 3D dust distribution
Galactic Archeology, 
Galaxy formation, structure, kinematics; proper motions of Milky Way satellites and Local group members</p>

<p>I am mainly interested in the structure of the Milky Way and I am working on the recalibration of the geometric parameters used in the TRILEGAL population synthesis model to describe the components of the Milky Way.</p>

<p>Techniques</p>

<p>Astrometry,</p>

<p>crowded field photometry
crowded field photometry
Interested in crowded field astrometry/ photometry (link to Gaia and modelling for future GaiaNIR development).</p>

<p>Synergies</p>

<p>Also, large scale studies of exoplanet host star environments (both in better understanding local contamination of PLATO bright stars but also the signature of exoplanets on the host star populations).</p>

<p>Exploring synergies Rubin - Gaia/PLATO/4MOST/WEAVE.</p>

<p>Interested in a wide-range of applications due to current work as part of LSST:UK on catalogue cross-matching, 
including as many systematic effects that will otherwise affect value-added datasets 
(e.g., crowding and perturbation of astrometry due to unresolved contaminants, 
contamination of fluxes due to the same unresolved objects, 
un-accounted for proper motions, etc.), 
and hence issues that affect other astronomersâ€™ studies using multi-band data such as those we will provide through the LSST:UK DAC.</p>
