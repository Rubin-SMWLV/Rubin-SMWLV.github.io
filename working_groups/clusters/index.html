<h1>SMWLV Star Clusters Working Group</h1>

<P>
The Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST)
will measure new photometry and astrometry for objects that are too
faint for Gaia. The Star Clusters Working Group, a part of the
Stars, Milky Way & Local Volume Science Collaboration (SMWLV), will enable the systematic study and characterization of both resolved star clusters, as well as unresolved (extragalactic star clusters) out to distances of tens of megaparsecs.
</P>
See the <A HREF="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.17333.pdf">SMWLV Star Clusters
Roadmap</a> and <A HREF="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023arXiv230612620D/abstract"> Roman Core Community Survey Input white paper</a>.
<p>
We currently meet at a monthly cadence.
