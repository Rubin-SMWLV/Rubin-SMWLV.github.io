<h1>SMWLV Solar Neighborhood Working Group</h1>

<P>
The Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST)
will measure new photometry and astrometry for objects that are too
faint for Gaia. The Solar Neighborhood Working Group, a part of the
Stars, Milky Way & Local Volume Science Collaboration (SMWLV), will enable the
discovery and study of very-low-mass stars, brown dwarfs, and white
dwarfs within 200 parsecs of the Sun.  
</P>
See the <A HREF="https://rubin-smwlv.github.io/roadmap.html">SMWLV 
Roadmap</a>.
