<h2>SMWLV public documents page</h2>

SMWLV documentation is generally stored in the public google drive folder 
<a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1AQrUxGFGZbR2ez95URoD-8dE7rQd2NmF">
SMWLV_public. 
</a>
While the naming convention of the subfolders is reasonably transparent, here are a few items that may be of interest:

<h2>Governance documents</h2>

SMWLV is in the process of formalizing its structure, 
including setting a formal charter, publications policy, and code of conduct. 
Setting up these policies and their ratification by collaboration members, 
is planned for the 2021-2022 academic year. 
Draft governance documents appear in the google folder

SMWLV_governanceDocs.

<h2>Telecon agendas/livenotes</h2>

Agendas/livenotes docs for the monthly SMWLV collaboration-wide 
telecons appear in the following folder:

<h2>Presentations & talk resources</h2>

Resources for talks (e.g. the SMWLV logo) and previous presentations 
(as google slides, powerpoint or pdf) can be found here. 
If you present on behalf of SMWLV, we encourage you to share your 
talk here so others in the collaboration can benefit:
